# Description
The idea is testing the time for a server response between Ruby and NodeJS.
We're using a sample file **test.txt** with 80kb and 20_000 lines with.

# How is works
We read the test.txt file and made a concatenation with the result of the file 1_000 times.

## Ruby
I used [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack ) and [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma) to testing this.
I chose **Rack** because [here](https://github.com/luislavena/bench-micro) I see
that have better performance against others web microframeworks
I chose **Puma** because offers a lean and fast web server solution for
applications that require high concurrency.

I run the Puma server with 8 threads
```
puma -e production -t 8:8 ruby.ru
```

## NodeJS

## Benchmark tool
I use the **siege** command (sudo apt-get install siege)
```
siege -b -r 10 -c 10 http://localhost:9292
```
